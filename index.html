          I'm a junior at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, majoring in Computer Science. I love playing games in my
          free time, and my dream is to become a developer and create the things I love. This is a website that I built
          from scratch to hold anything I wish to share, so have a look around!

            This is my first time building a website from scratch, though I've learned some HTML and CSS in the past. I am
            currently learning about Sass, Node, and Bootstrap, hoping to implement them to create an eye-catching,
            responsive website.

            On December 22, 2020, I made one of my first projects, using inline JavaScript! It's a simple game of "Rock,
            Paper, Scissors" with some added features. It's definitely not the prettiest website ever made.
